# JavaScript → Go

Master Go programming language through the lens of JavaScript development, with a focus on concurrency, system programming, and cloud-native development.

## Why Learn Go?

Go (Golang) is a modern programming language designed for simplicity, efficiency, and concurrency. As a JavaScript developer, learning Go will expand your capabilities in:

- **Concurrent Programming**: Master Goroutines and Channels for efficient concurrent code
- **System Programming**: Build high-performance system-level applications
- **Microservices**: Create scalable microservice architectures
- **Cloud-Native Development**: Deploy applications in modern cloud environments
- **Performance**: Achieve near-C performance with garbage collection

## What You'll Learn

### Core Concepts
- Go syntax and type system compared to JavaScript
- Package management and module system
- Interfaces and type assertions
- Error handling patterns

### Concurrency & Performance
- Goroutines vs JavaScript async/await
- Channel communication patterns
- Select statements for non-blocking operations
- Performance optimization techniques

### Web Development
- HTTP server development
- RESTful API design
- GraphQL services
- WebSocket implementations

### Modern Go Features
- Generics (Go 1.18+)
- Workspaces for multi-module projects
- Fuzz testing
- Performance profiling

## Learning Path

The learning path is organized into **14 progressive modules**:

1. **Go Introduction**: Understanding Go's design philosophy and comparing it with JavaScript
2. **Syntax Comparison**: Mapping JavaScript concepts to Go syntax and patterns
3. **Package System**: Understanding Go modules and package management
4. **Types & Interfaces**: Mastering Go's type system and interface patterns
5. **Concurrency & Goroutines**: Learning concurrent programming with Goroutines
6. **Channels & Select**: Mastering Channel communication and Select statements
7. **Error Handling**: Understanding Go's error handling philosophy
8. **Web Development**: Building web services and APIs with Go
9. **Microservices**: Developing microservice architectures
10. **Cloud-Native Development**: Deploying applications in cloud environments
11. **Testing & Debugging**: Writing tests and debugging Go applications
12. **Projects**: Real-world projects to apply your knowledge
13. **Common Pitfalls**: Avoiding common mistakes in Go development
14. **Idiomatic Go**: Writing idiomatic and performant Go code

## Quick Start

Let's begin with a simple comparison between JavaScript and Go:

<UniversalEditor title="Hello World Comparison" compare={true}>
```javascript !! js
// JavaScript
function greet(name) {
    return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

console.log(greet("World"));
```

```go !! go
// Go
package main

import "fmt"

func greet(name string) string {
    return fmt.Sprintf("Hello, %s!", name)
}

func main() {
    fmt.Println(greet("World"))
}
```
</UniversalEditor>

## Key Differences

| Aspect | JavaScript | Go |
|--------|------------|----|
| **Type System** | Dynamic typing | Static typing |
| **Concurrency** | Event loop, async/await | Goroutines, channels |
| **Memory Management** | Garbage collection | Garbage collection |
| **Compilation** | JIT compilation | Ahead-of-time compilation |
| **Runtime** | V8 engine | Go runtime |
| **Package Management** | npm/yarn | go mod |
