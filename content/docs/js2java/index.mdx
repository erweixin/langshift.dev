# JavaScript → Java

Master Java programming language from a JavaScript developer's perspective. This comprehensive course covers object-oriented programming, enterprise development, Spring framework, concurrency, JVM optimization, and modern Java features.

## Why Learn Java?

Java is one of the most popular programming languages for enterprise development, known for its:

- **Object-Oriented Design**: Robust class-based inheritance and polymorphism
- **Enterprise-Grade**: Extensive ecosystem for large-scale applications
- **Spring Framework**: Leading framework for enterprise Java development
- **Concurrency**: Built-in support for multi-threading and parallel processing
- **JVM Performance**: Optimized runtime with garbage collection
- **Cross-Platform**: Write once, run anywhere philosophy

## What You'll Learn

### Core Java Concepts
- Object-oriented programming principles
- Strong typing and type safety
- Exception handling and error management
- Generics and collections framework
- Concurrency and multi-threading

### Enterprise Development
- Spring Framework fundamentals
- Dependency injection and IoC
- RESTful API development
- Database integration with JPA
- Microservices architecture

### Modern Java Features
- Lambda expressions and functional programming
- Stream API for data processing
- Optional class for null safety
- Module system (Java 9+)
- Performance optimization techniques

## Learning Path

### Foundation (Modules 0-5)
Start with Java basics, syntax comparison, and fundamental concepts.

### Object-Oriented Programming (Modules 6-10)
