# JavaScript â†’ C Programming

Master the C programming language through the lens of a JavaScript developer. This comprehensive course will guide you from JavaScript's high-level abstractions to C's powerful low-level control, focusing on memory management, pointers, system programming, and performance optimization.

## Why Learn C?

C is the foundation of modern computing. Understanding C gives you:

- **Deep System Understanding**: Learn how computers actually work at the hardware level
- **Memory Control**: Master manual memory management and pointer operations
- **Performance Optimization**: Write high-performance code with minimal overhead
- **System Programming**: Build operating systems, drivers, and embedded applications
- **Career Growth**: C skills are highly valued in systems programming, embedded development, and performance-critical applications

## What You'll Learn

### Core Concepts
- **Memory Management**: From JavaScript's garbage collection to C's manual memory control
- **Pointers**: Master the most powerful and challenging concept in C
- **System Programming**: Understand how to interact directly with hardware
- **Performance Optimization**: Write code that runs at near-machine speed

### Practical Skills
- **Data Structures**: Implement arrays, linked lists, trees, and graphs from scratch
- **Algorithms**: Write efficient sorting, searching, and graph algorithms
- **File I/O**: Handle file operations and data persistence
- **Network Programming**: Build network applications and servers

### Advanced Topics
- **Multi-threading**: Concurrent programming with threads
- **System Calls**: Direct operating system interaction
- **Embedded Programming**: Microcontroller and IoT development
- **Performance Analysis**: Profiling and optimization techniques
